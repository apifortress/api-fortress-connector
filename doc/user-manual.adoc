== Introduction

API Fortress is a world leader in API testing. The API Fortress Anypoint connector allows you to serialize your API responses in Mule and send them to API Fortress for testing. Based on the configuration, the results of the tests can be sent back to the Mule flow or be stored in API Fortress for further analysis.

Read through this user guide to understand how to set up and configure a basic flow using the connector.

MuleSoft maintains this connector under the link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/anypoint-connectors#connector-categories[MuleSoft Certified] support policy.


== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule,
link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors], and
link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-studio-essentials[Anypoint Studio Essentials]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing a link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/basic-studio-tutorial[Anypoint Studio Tutorial]. This page requires some basic knowledge of link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/mule-concepts[Mule Concepts], link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/elements-in-a-mule-flow[Elements in a Mule Flow], and link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/global-elements[Global Elements].

To use the API Fortress connector you must have the following:

* Anypoint Studio

|===

== Installing the Connector

You can install the connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in
link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-exchange#installing-a-connector-from-anypoint-exchange[Installing a Connector from Anypoint Exchange].

=== Upgrading from an Older Version

If you’re currently using an older version of the connector, a small popup appears in the bottom right corner of Anypoint Studio with an "Updates Available" message.

. Click the popup and check for available updates. 
. Click the Connector version checkbox and click *Next* and follow the instructions provided by the user interface. 
. *Restart* Studio when prompted. 
. After restarting, when creating a flow and using the connector, if you have several versions of the connector installed you may be asked which version you would like to use. Choose the version you would like to use.

Additionally, we recommend that you keep Studio up to date with the latest version.


== Before using the connector
Before you start using the connector (other than running the demo) here's a few thing you should know.

=== Register/Upgrade an API Fortress account
The trial account will provide you access to most API Fortress features, including the API that is required to run the connector. The evaluation lasts 30 days. Register your account for free at link:https://mastiff.apifortress.com[mastiff.apifortress.com].

Refer to link:http://apifortress.com[apifortress.com] for pricing and options.

=== Build a test for your API
Build a test using the API Fortress visual composer. As the payload will be forwarded from the Mule engine, the test is not required to perform the I/O operation to retrieve the resource so it will generally contain only assertions
evaluting the content of the `payload` variable.

A good way to get started (even though not required) is using the HTTP console to either perform a test call (when available) or pasting an example payload in the "Response" tab to get suggestions during composition.

Once this is done, building a test using the visual composer is pretty straight forward.
image:api-fortress-composer.png[Composer]

Please refer to link:http://apifortress.com/doc/[the API Fortress documentation] for extensive guides on how to get the best results from API Fortress.

=== Collect the information you will need
To use the API Fortress API to run tests, you will need the following information:

* *API Hook URL* : API Fortress generated URLs representing a project. You can generate one by accessing your company page. By simply having knowledge of this URL, you can access all the operations that do not expose sensitive data, including running tests
image:api-fortress-hooks.png[API Hooks]

* *Test ID* :  when running a single test, you will need the test ID, which can be retrieved in the test interstitial page
image:api-fortress-interstitial.png[Interstitial page]



== Configuring the Connector Global Element

To use the API Fortress connector in your Mule application, you must configure a global API Fortress element that can be used by the API Fortress connector (read more about  link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/global-elements[Global Elements]). The API Fortress connector offers the following global configuration:
[width="100a",cols="50a,50a",options="header",]
|===
|Field |Description
|*connectTimeout* | Timeout to connect in seconds. Increase it if your connection to the API Fortress instance has long latencies.
|*socketTimeout* | Socket timeout in seconds. Increase it if your connection to the API Fortress instance is slow.
|*totalConnections* | Maximum number of parallel HTTP connections. A high number will effect resource consumption. A small number will slow the connector down
|*threshold* | Run a test after a certain number of requests have been received. Used to reduce the samples
|*silent* | True if the API Fortress cloud shouldn't send failure notifications.
|*dryRun* | True if the API Fortress cloud shouldn't store test results.

|===

image:api-fortress-global-configuration.png[Global Configuration]




== Using the Connector


The connector can be placed anywhere in a Mule flow. The payload can either be a plain JSON/XML string or a POJO object that will be converted in JSON. 

Other than the payload, the connector will require access to the response headers you can configure in the connector instance configuration. The "content-type" header should be present, otherwise text/plain will be used.

=== Operations

[width="100a",cols="20a,30a,50a",options="header",]
|===
|Operation |Description| Parameters
|*single test synchronous* | The serialized API call will be forwarded to the API Fortress engine and one test will be run against it. Eventually, the connector will wait for the result of the test and set it as payload | payload, hook,testId,headers,variables.
|*single test passthrough* | Will perform the same operation as the synchronous mode, but will not wait for the test results and release the flow as soon as it gets an acceptance confirmation from API Fortress. The original payload is preserved in the flow | payload, hook,testId,headers,variables.
|*automatch synchronous* | The serialized API call will be forwarded to the API Fortress engine that will choose which tests to run based on the 'automatch' field. Eventually, the connector will wait for the result of the tests and set them as payload | payload, hook,headers,variables.
|*automatch passthrough* | Will perform the same operation as the synchronous mode, but will not wait for the test results and release the flow as soon as it gets an acceptance confirmation from API Fortress. The original payload is preserved in the flow | payload, hook,testId,headers,variables.

|===

=== Parameters

[width="100a",cols="10a,70a,10a,10a",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter | Description | Default | Required
|*payload* | A reference to the payload to be tested. I generally is made of text, but can be a POJO as well | `#[payload]` | yes 
|*hook* | the API Hook URL identifying one project, as described in the chapter "Collect the information you will need" | | yes 
|*testId* | For a single test run, the ID of the test to run. It can be retrieved in a test interstitial page, as described in the "Collect the information you will need" | | yes  
|*automatch* | For automatch operations, a path that identifies the URL of the endpoint. Please refer to the link:http://apifortress.com/doc/automatch/[Automatch documentation] | | yes
|*headers* | an API response payload is generally decorated by multiple headers you might want to test. Though not required, it is strongly suggested to provide at least the 'content-type' header | `#[message.inboundProperties]` | no 
|*variables* | Extra variables to be injected in the scope of the test. Examples could be the server name, the flow name, or the local time. The variables will be accessible to the test just like the `payload` variable | empty | no

|=== 

=== Connector Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in Studio, the act of dragging the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas should automatically populate the XML code with the connector *namespace* and *schema location*.

*Namespace:* `http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector`
*Schema Location:* `http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector/current/mule-connector.xsd`

[TIP]
If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or other text editor, define the namespace and schema location in the header of your *Configuration XML*, inside the `<mule>` tag.

[source, xml,linenums]

=== Simple Passthrough Use Case

Before you implement this example, make sure you read and applied the "Before using the connector" chapter.

Here's the user case we are going to implement in the Anypoint Studio UI.
image:api-fortress-use-case-1.png[The flow]

The simplest use case is the validation of a response coming from an endpoint.

. Set up a basic HTTP entry point by dragging the HTTP connector from the palette to your canvas. Create a global configuration with the default values (port 8081)

. Drag and drop on the canvas an HTTP request connector as second step of the flow. Configure the instance to perform an HTTP call to an API endpoint of your choice.
Refer to link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/http-request-connector[the HTTP request connector documentation]

. Drag from the palette API Fortress connector and drop it as 3rd element. Create the default global configuration, setting silent=true.

image:api-fortress-use-case-2.png[Global configuration example]

. Select the "Single test passthrough" operation.

. Leave the headers input as default

. In your API Fortress account, in the company dashboard, create an API Hook URL for your project. Use it as the "hook" parameter.

. In your API Fortress account, in the test details page, obtain a test ID. Use it as the "testId" parameter.

image:api-fortress-use-case-3.png[Connector configuration]

. Run the flow in your Mule engine

. Hit the url `http://localhost:8081` with an HTTP client of your choice. The flow should return the payload provided by the second HTTP connector 

. In the API Fortress project dashboard, verify the test has run and produced a report
